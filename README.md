The "PIG GAME" is a multiplayer game played with two six-sided die.The objective of the game is to reach 100 points or more.Play is taken in turns. On each person's turn that person has the option of either:
 1. Rolling the dice: where a roll of two to six ( for both the dice ) is added to their score for that turn and the player's turn     continues as the player is given the same choice again;   or a roll of   1   loses the player's total points for that turn and their turn finishes with play passing to the next player.
 2. Holding: the player's score for that round is added to their total and becomes safe from the effects of throwing a  1  (one).                   The player's turn finishes with play passing to the next player.
